# SalesForceCodingChallenge


# Introduction
As part of the challenge, I had to build a java application which takes into account user location and returns the list of three closest coffee shops.
The coffee shop list is a commaÂ­separated file with rows of the following form:
      Name,YCoordinate,XCoordinate

# Approach 

## Design Structure

The solution is divided into 3 classes as below
- CoffeeShopFutureForce.java: This class implements the main function and finds the top3 closest shops using helper classes
- Coordinates.java: This class defines x,y co-ordinates of location
- CoffeeShopDistance.java: This class stores coffee name and its distance from user

## Data Structures Used

Max-Heap using Java Priority-Queue: The basic idea used is to read the input CSV file line-by-line and store the required data into a CoffeeShopDistance obejct at every	instance. For storing the closest three coffee shops seen till now, a max-heap of  size three is maintained. Whenever a new coffee shop data is read, I compare the distance of current coffee shop with the root element of max-heap using the comparator defined for PriorityQueue. If the distance of current coffee shop is less, the root element/ max element is pulled-out and current coffee shop is inserted. 

ArrayList: After the entire file is read, all the CoffeeShopDistance objects are dequed/ extracted from the PriorityQueue and added to ArrayList. Finally, they are printed in the increasing order of distance (reverse order of the list).

# Time Complexity & Analysis 

- Time to Parse the CSV file, read all the lines and compute Euclidean distances from user : O(n) where n is number of coffee shops (i.e. no of lines in the CSV file)
- Time for single insertion into Max heap: O(logN) where N is the number of entries in the heap

# Run Environment  
Built in Java SE 1.8
